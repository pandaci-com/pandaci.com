**Prerequisites**

You need an account before starting, create one [here](https://app.pandaci.com/signup).

{% /alert %}

## Create a new project

Once logged in, you can create a new project by clicking on the **New Project** button located at the top right corner of the projects page.

{% alert level="info" %}

If you can't see the repo you want, make sure our [GitHub app](https://github.com/apps/pandaci-com/installations/new) has access to it.

{% /alert %}

## Write your first workflow

PandaCI uses [Deno](https://deno.com) to define workflows. Don't worry, you don't need to know Deno to get started.

Create a new file called `.pandaci/hello-world.workflow.ts` and add the following code:

```typescript {% title=".pandaci/hello-world.workflow.ts" %}
import { docker, $, job, env } from "jsr:@pandaci/workflow";

// Creates a docker task on a 4-core machine
// same as wrapping with `job("some-name", () => { ... })`
docker("ubuntu:latest", { name: "hello world" }, () => {
  // Runs a shell command
  $`echo "Hello, world! from branch: ${env.PANDACI_BRANCH}"`;
});

// Creates 2 docker tasks on an 2-core machine
job("Job 2", { runner: "ubuntu-2x" }, async () => {
  let files = '';
  await docker("ubuntu:latest", async () => {
    // Runs the command in the .pandaci directory
    // and stores the output as a string
    files = await $`ls`.cwd(".pandaci").text();
  });
  await docker("ubuntu:latest", () => {
    // we can easily share data between tasks or even jobs
    $`echo "files from another task: ${files}"`;
  });
});
```

Learn more about the [workflow syntax](/docs/typescript/api/overview).

{% /alert %}


PandaCI will run any files in the **.pandaci** directory that end with **.workflow.ts**. By default, they're triggered on every push. Learn how to [configure triggers](/docs/typescript/config/triggers).

## Commit and push your changes

After pushing, PandaCI will automatically detect the new workflow and start running it. You can see the progress in the PandaCI dashboard.



### Congratulations ðŸŽ‰
You've just created your first CI/CD pipeline with PandaCI.
